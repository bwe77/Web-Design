            Apart from the structure of the HTML file, they also contain tags in the body section of the file. These tags are

            </p>
                
            <p>Apart from the same structure they share, all of the HTML files share other similarities in order to provide consistency, 
                like the fact that they follow the same font-size hierarchy; H1 > H2, H2 > H3, H3 > p, p = footer,
               all of the words present in the page have the same font (font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;), 
               and the body the page has a padding of 25px. Lastly, the colours and background colours of all the pages are the same.

            <h3 class="h_center">CSS Selectors</h3>
            <hr class="line">

            <p>There were numerous amounts of CSS selectors that were used in this website, 
                primarily ID Selectors and Class Selectors. Most of these Selectors are mentioned and 
                explained in the <a class="tableLink" href="table.html">table </a> (click the link to view the table).
            </p>

            <h3 class="h_center">Aesthetics of The Web Page</h3>
            <hr class="line">
            
            <p>
                The chosen design and layout of the web page is meant to be please the viewers, and 
                the given layout of the web page is meant to be simple as necessary for the viewers to view and 
                navigate through, and not at all complex.</p>
            <p>
                The background-colours used in the web page (header(image), body(lavender), footer(image), texts (black)) is not too bright that it in some way blinds the viewers and it is not too dark
                that it hinders the readability. So, in order to balance it out, the given colours are a mixture of both bright and dark.
                Furthermore, the images included in the content, helps the viewers to understand the texts even more.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a hierarchy of font sizes throughout the whole web page (H1 > H2, H2 > H3, H3 > p, p = footer). This prevents confusion 
                for the viewers to understand which texts are a part of heading, paragraphs, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                The div tags divide parts of the texts from each other, allowing the texts to be tidy and easy for the viewers to read.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, the padding of the body part of the web page, provides a simpler look as opposed to the original 100% width.
            </p>


            <h3 class="h_center">Accessibility of The Web Page</h3>
            <hr class="line">

            <p>
                The use of HTML Structures, like headings, lists, and tables can benefit viewers with disabilites, as it provides context.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every image provided in the web page has the 'alt' atrribute which provides a description or explanation of the images to viewers who may be visually impaired.
                This may also be benefit during times where internet connections are too slow to process the images.
            </p>
            <p>
                The menu or the navigation bar works as an assistive tool that helps viewers to easily navigate through the web page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the decreased width size of the web page allows viewers to read easily and without the need to constantly rotate their heads
