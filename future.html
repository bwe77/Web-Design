                    <p>For the next 3 years, I plan to learn what there is to know abou the IT field from the courses here is UTS, and I plan to pass all these subjects as well as completing my degree, in the hopes that the knowledge 
                    gained from university will help me in future careers.

            <h3 class="h_center">After University </h3>
            <hr class="line">

            <p>After University, I plan to keep learning more about the field, as technology keeps improving overtime, there's always something new to learn about in IT. 
            I might try to learn how to code on more programming languages that are becoming popular these days for future careers. Furthermore, I plan to earn work experiences through internships.

                    <hr class="line">

                    <p>As I've mentioned, I plan to do various internships and beginner level jobs in the IT field in order to get more work experiences, 
                    but afterwards, I would try to get a full-time/permanent job. Someday, I wish to work in one of the companies shown in the picture above. 
                    My goal in this field is to make a difference someday and make life easier with tools such as AI at my disposal.
