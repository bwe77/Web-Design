            <hr class="line">

            <p>Before University, I had very little experience in the field IT. In preperation for university, 
                I researched a little bit about it, which led me to learn/relearn more about 
                coding and programming. Afterwards, I started to watch tutorials on how to code in Python on Youtube.</p>

                    <p>Back in school, we did have a subject called "ICT", in which we would learn how to use the tools 
                    or applications in our school computers. During year 7 to year 10, we did learn about the hardwares of a 
                    computer for a bit and we also learned how to code on Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but overtime I forgot about most of it. </p></div>
